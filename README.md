#Welcome to  my python certification project
##about
<p>
This project is my pyfun certification project, I will be creating
a terminal based python flashcards program with tons of functionality.
For example, many many modes, a config file, and lots of features.</p>
##install
<p>How to install:</p>
1. Clone this project using https
1. run the setup script under sudo user ie `sudo ./setup`
1. At the prompt, type your home directory's full path with a /.sets at the end, for example, /home/robert/.sets, if you are in root, /home/root/.sets. If you type this wrong, dont worry, you will have another chance when you run the program

##uninstall
run `sudo ./uninstall`
##usage
Right now, there are three options, create a set, used with -s <name>,
and run, -r. -r will have you select a file with autocompletion. and
-l. -l will list all of the files that you have. If you want to delete a  file, enter -d, there will be an option to delete from a selection of your choice. This also has autocompletion
